# Car-Parking-Availability-Sensor
This project can be implemented in any car park to determine the number of available spaces. 
The project uses ultrasonic sensors to detect whether a car space is occupied or empty.
This information is then wirelessly transmitted using the HC-12 WIFI chip to an LCD which will show the number of spaces available.
The available spaces can also be viewed in the Arduino serial monitor and can be changed to show multiple other outputs such as
which space is empty/full and also the distance from the sensor to the car which could determine improper parking.
An LED has also been added to each car space and will be on when a space is vacant and off when the space is occupied.
